# on_graph
Processes a graph from edges searching for the shortest path.

Scan input file, create orient graph like list of edges, assuming the vertex count equals the crossroad count and find the shortest paths between two known vertexes using the Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm. Graph can contain negative edges.
