# on_graph
Processes a graph from edges by searching for the shortest path.

Scans input file, creates orient graph like list of edges, assuming the vertex count equals the crossroad count and find the shortest path between two known vertexes using the Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm. Graph can contain negative edges.
